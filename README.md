## Hi there <img src="assets/wave.gif" width="28px" alt="hi"> welcome to my Profile

Greetings! I'm Nozibul Islam, a passionate and versatile  Web Application developer with a deep understanding of various technologies. With a strong foundation in JavaScript, TypeScript, I specialize in frameworks like Next.js, React,js and many more, ensuring robust and scalable backend solutions.

My expertise extends to Next.js and React.js, where I excel in crafting custom themes and plugins to meet specific project requirements. On the frontend, I'm well-versed in React, building dynamic and responsive user interfaces that elevate the overall user experience. Additionally, I leverage Next.js for seamless and efficient server-side rendering, providing fast-loading and SEO-friendly web applications.

In the realm of server-side development, I have a solid command of Node.js, while my database proficiency spans across MySQL and MongoDB. Additionally, my familiarity with AWS allows me to deploy and manage applications efficiently in the cloud.

With a commitment to staying current with the ever-evolving tech landscape, I bring a holistic approach to web development, ensuring that both the frontend and backend seamlessly integrate to deliver exceptional digital experiences.
